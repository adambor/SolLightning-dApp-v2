                                We've rebranded SolLightning to <strong>atomiq.exchange</strong> as it better represents our product, and doesn't
                                convey false information that we only support bitcoin lightning. The name atomiq refers to atomic swaps, which are our core
                                differentiator and allow us to secure our swaps by cryptography and bitcoin's proof-of-work. This is in stark contrast
                                to cross-chain bridges, which generally use a federation of validators and their security heavily depends on bridge token's price.

                                <strong>atomiq.exchange</strong> is a fully trustless cross-chain DEX (decentralized exchange) allowing you to swap between
                                Solana assets (SOL and USDC) and Bitcoin (on-chain and on the lightning network). All swaps are done atomically, so you
                                are never exposed to the risk of losing funds.
                            </p>

                                atomiq.exchange was launched in mid June 2023, by a team of blockchain veterans to provide the first fully trustless way
                                to swap between Solana & Bitcoin ecosystems.

                                The whole swap is fully trustless and atomic, therefore you are not trusting anyone with the swap funds.

                            <p>
                                This means that your trade counterparty can only take the swap funds once it processes the swap (e.g. pay you out in BTC for Solana -&gt; Bitcoin swaps, or pay you out in Solana asset for Bitcoin -&gt; Solana swaps)
                                - this is ensured by using Submarine swaps and Proof-time locked contracts.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In case the counterparty don't cooperate you can claim the full amount back in a short while (5 days for lightning network swaps & 1 day for on-chain swaps) - this is ensured by smart contract on Solana.

                                You don't have to trust anyone with your swap, if the counterparty doesn't cooperate the smart contract makes sure you get the funds back.
                                This is in stark contrast to centralized exchanges where you have to fully trust the exchange to not run away with your funds!

                                For our swaps to work in a fully trustless way the user needs to be able to cover the gas/transaction fees on Solana.
                                This means that new Solana users with 0 SOL balance were unable to use atomiq, even for BTC -&gt; SOL swaps - to solve this we run a trusted <b>swap for gas</b> service, allowing users to swap small amounts of BTC (lightning network) to SOL,
                                allowing them to then trustlessly use atomiq, even when starting with 0 SOL balance.
