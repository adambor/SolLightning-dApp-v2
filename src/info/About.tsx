                <p>
                    <strong>atomiq.exchange</strong> (formerly SolLightning) is a fully trustless cross-chain DEX (decentralized exchange) allowing you to swap between
                    Solana assets (SOL and USDC) and Bitcoin (on-chain and on the lightning network). All swaps are done atomically, so you
                    are never exposed to the risk of losing funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We envision a future free from centralized exchanges, where you are always in control of your funds!
